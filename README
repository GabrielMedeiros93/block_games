An opencv project I created to get a hang of OpenCV and abstract data types.
I'm just fooling around with classes and objects.

At the moment it's good enough to do simple 2D graphics on a grid.
And I can use my keyboard to move around objects in this grid. If you're curious, compile
and try pressing W,A,S,D ;)

Right now what this library can do is limited. I'll update this README if there is any
significant progress
